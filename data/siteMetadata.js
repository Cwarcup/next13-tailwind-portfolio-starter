      description:
        'For 15 years I have worked with individuals who have been impacted by substance use, relationship challenges, and intergenerational trauma. I feel a great sense of compassion and empathy towards people who have a genuine desire to create healthy relationships and boundaries but are stuck due to unresolved trauma. I am a firm believer that everyone’s journey is going to be unique and I respect that counselling is a healing process that begins only when an individual is ready to embrace change. I have a tremendous amount of gratitude for the work that I do and deeply value trust, transparency, and honesty in my collaborative relationship with clients.',
